# Whatâ€™s difference between The Internet and The Web ?

- The Internet is a global network of networks while the Web, also referred formally as World Wide Web (www) is collection of information which is accessed via the Internet. 
- Another way to look at this difference is; the Internet is infrastructure while the Web is service on top of that infrastructure.
- Alternatively, the Internet can be viewed as a big book-store while the Web can be viewed as collection of books on that store. 
- At a high level, we can even think of the Internet as hardware and the Web as software!

# Some Recap
## uri=url+urn=iri

- these are the types of resources
- we can share or get the resources
- we interact with the resources in regards to certain rules/ protocols like http;coap
- these http, coap provides verbs such as GET,POST,PUT,DELETE and more
- these verbs are registered at IANA
- even if the contents are information resource, we get the representation of the resource
- we can negotiate for the representation of resource by maybe mentioning the ACCEPT type or ACCEPT language
- we can negotiate on the contentType along with ACCEPT, eg:ACCEPT ttl
- contentType=mediaType+characterEncoding
- Eg: of above is text/html+utf-8
- WebApis can be interacted using xml or json docs
- IOT / WOT: almost same as internet/web
- IOT protocol: COAP
- Coap is binarification of http
- Coap is a req, res interaction b/w client and server
- Coap gives a way to encode different verbs(GET,PUT,POST....) with few bytes
- MQTT: publish/subscirbe type of interaction protocol
- MQTT: topicNames and filter, QoS(quality of service)
- WebArchitectural styles like REST & HATEOAS
