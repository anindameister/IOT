## Why No Wires, No Batteries, No limits

- Wires make everything look ugly to the eyes of artistic people who are into admiring uniformity. A uniform seaBeach without dirtyPlasticsCups thrown by humans. Some artist may like that dirt because that means it is a place of humanTypeOfLiveliness. Anyway, it seems that the presence of batteries would also require them to be charged or being disposed making provision for dirtiness.
